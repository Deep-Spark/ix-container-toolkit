NVML API Reference

The NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) is a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and
managing various states within NVIDIA Tesla &tm; GPUs. It is intended to be a platform for building
3rd party applications, and is also the underlying library for the NVIDIA-supported nvidia-smi
tool. NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads.

API Documentation

Supported platforms:
- Windows:     Windows Server 2008 R2 64bit, Windows Server 2012 R2 64bit, Windows 7 64bit, Windows 8 64bit, Windows 10 64bit
- Linux:       32-bit and 64-bit
- Hypervisors: Windows Server 2008R2/2012 Hyper-V 64bit, Citrix XenServer 6.2 SP1+, VMware ESX 5.1/5.5

Supported products:
- Full Support
    - All Tesla products, starting with the Fermi architecture
    - All Quadro products, starting with the Fermi architecture
    - All vGPU Software products, starting with the Kepler architecture
    - Selected GeForce Titan products
- Limited Support
    - All Geforce products, starting with the Fermi architecture

The NVML library can be found at \%ProgramW6432\%\\"NVIDIA Corporation"\\NVSMI\\ on Windows. It is
not be added to the system path by default. To dynamically link to NVML, add this path to the PATH
environmental variable. To dynamically load NVML, call LoadLibrary with this path.

On Linux the NVML library will be found on the standard library path. For 64 bit Linux, both the 32 bit
and 64 bit NVML libraries will be installed.

Online documentation for this library is available at http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html
